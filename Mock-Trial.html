			<p>When I was a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison I joined the Mock Trial Team at UW. I mostly play Witness Roles and in my firts year on the team our program went to national where I double sided. Currently in my Junior year I have awarded as a top overall witness in our invitationals and I look forward to competing in the Spring. hopefully UW-Madison can once again make it to the national competition in Memphis, Tennessee.
