			<p>In College one of the most important lessons that I have learned is that having good and reliable friends is necessary. I have made so many great friends who have helped me overcome everything difficult in my life. Another lesson i have learned is that you need friends for different aspects of your life. I have friends in my classes and majors as well as friends that I just hangout on the weekend with or work with. Friends especially in college become your family and can help lessen homesickness which is important. Below I have included some pictures and descriptions of some of my best friends!
